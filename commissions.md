  <h1>Commissions</h1>
  <p align="center">
    Prices are in USD. I don't have a restriction on which models I texture, but I am more comfortable painting some over others. To request a commission or ask a question you can contact me by dms through Discord at <a href="https://discord.com/users/158056840402436096/">Auxesis#0837</a> or by email <a href="mailto:justin@auxlabs.org?subject=Commission Request">justin@auxlabs.org</a>.

## Trades
#### Ask me

---

## Accessory Texture
#### Ask me
You have an accessory, article of clothing, or some other non-avatar model you want textured. Since these vary a lot in complexity I can't really set a single price.

---

## Recolor
#### $5
You want a simple pallete swap for the texture of a model. This includes any of the textures on [my gumroad](https://auxlabs.gumroad.com/), whether you've purchased them or not.

---

## Speed Paint Character
#### $20
I'll paint a texture of your character with less fine-detail than I normally would. The visual difference between this and the normal tier could be compared to flat colors versus shaded in a 2d drawing.

---

## Mystery Design
#### $20+
You tell me some keywords or provide a random image of what you want and I'll make a unique design based on it. The complexity of the final design is based on price.

---

## Character
#### Simple $40
#### Complex $60
You have a reference of your character that shows exactly what you want.

---

## Your Design
#### Simple $60
#### Complex $80
You give me a description and/or some images of what you want your texture to look like and I do my best to interpret them into the design you're looking for.
