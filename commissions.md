    Prices are in USD. I don't have a restriction on which models I texture, but I am more comfortable painting some over others. To request a commission or ask a question you can contact me by dms through Discord at <a href="https://discord.com/users/158056840402436096/">Auxesis#0001</a> or by email <a href="mailto:justin@auxlabs.org?subject=Commission Request">justin@auxlabs.org</a>.

You already have a reference for your character that shows exactly what you want.

## Your Design
#### Simple $60
